# First Unicorn Startup — UI/UX Design System Spec

## Overview

**Goal:** World-class UI/UX for firstunicornstartup.com that makes enthusiastic Indian startup founders feel like they're getting a premium experience — educational, enjoyable, and shareable — while backed by the most robust professional valuation backend.

**Target User Psychology:** Enthusiastic startup founders (GenZ to boomers) who ask "What am I worth?" — not valuation professionals. The UX should feel like a personal discovery journey, not a consulting engagement. Professional credibility is the reason they trust the number, not the reason they visit.

**Design Philosophy:** Premium Professional with founder-first messaging. Dark navy/gold aesthetic conveys authority. Cinematic reveal creates shareable moments. Educational tooltips demystify valuation. Mobile-first for WhatsApp sharing culture.

**Tech Stack Addition:** Framer Motion (8kb gzipped) for animations on top of existing Next.js 14 + Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui stack.

## Design System Foundation

### Color Palette

```
Primary Navy:    hsl(222, 47%, 11%)  — #0f172a  (backgrounds, hero)
Deep Slate:      hsl(217, 33%, 17%)  — #1e293b  (cards, surfaces)
Gold Accent:     hsl(38, 92%, 50%)   — #f59e0b  (CTAs, highlights, confidence)
Gold Light:      hsl(45, 93%, 47%)   — #eab308  (hover states)
Warm White:      hsl(210, 40%, 98%)  — #f8fafc  (text on dark)
Muted Slate:     hsl(215, 20%, 65%)  — #94a3b8  (secondary text)
Success Green:   hsl(142, 71%, 45%)  — #22c55e  (positive metrics, >70% confidence)
Warning Amber:   hsl(38, 92%, 50%)   — #f59e0b  (40-70% confidence)
Risk Red:        hsl(0, 84%, 60%)    — #ef4444  (warnings, <40% confidence)
Chart Blue:      hsl(217, 91%, 60%)  — #3b82f6  (Income approach)
Chart Purple:    hsl(262, 83%, 58%)  — #8b5cf6  (Market approach)
Chart Emerald:   hsl(160, 84%, 39%)  — #10b981  (Asset/Cost approach)
Chart Amber:     hsl(38, 92%, 50%)   — #f59e0b  (VC/Startup methods)
```

**Approach color coding is consistent across every chart, card, and section in the app.** Income = blue, Market = purple, Asset = emerald, VC = amber.

### Typography

```
Hero H1:         Clash Display (700)     — geometric bold display, modern authority
Section Heads:   Cabinet Grotesk (700)   — distinctive grotesque, premium feel
Sub-headings:    Cabinet Grotesk (500)   — lighter weight for hierarchy
Body:            Satoshi (400/500)        — humanist sans, warm readability
Financial Figs:  Space Grotesk (600)      — monospace-adjacent for Rs figures
Micro Labels:    Satoshi (500 uppercase)  — badges, labels, categories
```

**Type Scale:**
```
Desktop:  H1: 72px | H2: 40px | H3: 24px | Body: 16px | Small: 14px | Micro: 12px
Tablet:   H1: 52px | H2: 32px | H3: 22px | Body: 16px | Small: 14px | Micro: 12px
Mobile:   H1: 36px | H2: 28px | H3: 20px | Body: 16px | Small: 14px | Micro: 12px
```

All fonts from Fontshare (Indian Type Foundry) — free, WOFF2, `font-display: swap`.

**Font subsetting:** Latin subset only, limited character set. Target: ~15-20kb per weight file. Total budget: 6 weight/family files × 18kb average = ~108kb WOFF2. Preload hero font (Clash Display 700) only; lazy-load others via `<link rel="preload" as="font">`.

**Contrast note:** Muted Slate `#94a3b8` on Deep Slate `#1e293b` yields ~4.1:1 ratio. For body text at 14px ("Small" scale), use `#a1a1aa` (zinc-400) instead for 4.6:1 ratio. Gold on navy (#f59e0b on #0f172a) at 5.7:1 passes AA.

### Spacing & Layout

- 8px grid system
- Max content width: 1280px (centered)
- Cards: 24px padding, 12px border-radius, `border border-slate-700/50`
- Glass effect: `bg-slate-800/60 backdrop-blur-xl`
- Touch targets: minimum 44px × 44px on all interactive elements

### Responsive Breakpoints

```
Mobile:    320px — 640px    (single column, stacked, bottom sheets)
Tablet:    641px — 1024px   (2-column where natural, sidebar TOC)
Desktop:   1025px — 1280px  (full sidebar TOC, 3-col grids)
Wide:      1281px+          (max-width container centered)
```

### Motion System (Framer Motion)

**Principles:**
- Every animation serves a purpose: guide attention, show relationships, or celebrate progress
- 60fps minimum — no janky animations
- `prefers-reduced-motion` → instant transitions, no animation

**Catalog:**
```
Enter:      fade up + scale 0.95→1.0, 400ms ease-out
Exit:       fade down + scale→0.95, 200ms ease-in
Stagger:    children enter 50ms apart
Numbers:    useSpring counting, 800ms
Charts:     pathLength draw 0→1, 1200ms
Scroll:     useInView(threshold: 0.2, once: true)
Page:       AnimatePresence — slide left/right 200ms
Hover:      translateY(-4px) + subtle shadow, 150ms
Press:      scale(0.98), 100ms
```

**Mobile motion reductions:**
- No particle effects (battery + performance)
- Simplified reveal animation (count-up + gauge only, no convergence)
- Swipe gestures via `drag` prop instead of complex transitions

---

## Screen 5: Detailed Report — Scrollytelling

### Desktop Layout

**2-column: sticky sidebar TOC (240px) + main content (rest)**

**Sidebar TOC:**
- Section list with active highlight (gold left border)
- Tracks scroll position — active section updates as user scrolls
- Fixed "Download PDF" button and "Get Certified" button at bottom
- Collapses to icon-only at 1025px breakpoint

**Tablet:** Sidebar TOC at 200px width, otherwise same.

**Mobile:** TOC is a collapsible dropdown at top of page, not sidebar. Tapping opens bottom sheet with section list. Sticky bottom bar alternates between "Download PDF" and "Get Certified" based on scroll position. "Back to top" floating button after 3 screens of scrolling.

### Main Content Sections (12 sections)

Each section:
- Fades in on scroll (Framer Motion `useInView`, `once: true`)
- Has alternating layouts to prevent monotony:
  - Full-width charts
  - Two-column data tables
  - Glass cards for key metrics
  - Interactive tools (cap table, ESOP)

**3-Layer Information Architecture for every metric:**
1. **Headline** — the number (Rs 9.2 Cr) — Space Grotesk
2. **One-liner** — what it means ("DCF values your future cash flows at Rs 9.2 Cr") — Satoshi
3. **Expandable detail** — click to see inputs, formula, Damodaran data used

**Educational tooltips on every financial term:**
- "WACC = the minimum return investors expect. Lower WACC = higher valuation."
- "Beta = how volatile your sector is compared to the overall market."
- Triggered by `(?)` icon, shown as popover (desktop) or bottom sheet (mobile)

**Note: Section ordering intentionally differs from functional spec for better UX narrative flow.** Listed Comparables moved near Comparable Startups (both are comparison sections). IBC Downside placed after comparables (provides risk context after seeing peers). Recommendations last (actionable takeaways as finale before CTA). This reordering improves the story arc: "What you're worth → How we calculated it → Who you compare to → What could go wrong → What to do next."

Total JS bundle:          < 200kb gzipped
Fonts:                    4 fonts (Clash Display, Cabinet Grotesk, Satoshi, Space Grotesk)
                          WOFF2 only, font-display: swap, subset to latin
Images:                   Zero raster images (all SVG icons via Lucide, CSS effects)
Framer Motion:            Tree-shaken, ~8kb used features
Charts (Recharts):        Lazy-loaded, only on pages that need them
```

### Mobile-Specific Performance

- No particle effects (battery conservation)
- Simplified reveal animation
- Lazy-load report sections below fold
- Service worker for offline wizard state persistence

---

## Accessibility

- WCAG 2.1 AA compliance minimum
- All interactive elements: 44px minimum touch target
- Color contrast: 4.5:1 minimum for body text, 3:1 for large text
- `prefers-reduced-motion`: instant transitions, no animation
- `prefers-color-scheme`: dark mode is default, light mode support deferred to Phase 2
- Screen reader: all charts have `aria-label` with text description of data
- Keyboard: full wizard navigation via Tab/Enter/Escape
- Focus visible: gold outline ring on all focusable elements

---

## Interaction Patterns

### Bottom Sheets (Mobile)
- Sector selector opens as bottom sheet with search
- Method detail cards open as bottom sheets (swipe down to dismiss)
- TOC on report page opens as bottom sheet overlay
- All bottom sheets: Framer Motion `drag` with `dragConstraints`

### Haptic Feedback (Android/Chrome Only — Silent Fallback on iOS)
- Uses `navigator.vibrate()` API — no support on iOS Safari as of 2026
- Degrades silently: no error, no alternative needed
- Number count-up completion: `vibrate(10)` (light tap)
- Step transition: `vibrate(10)` (light tap)
- CTA press: `vibrate(20)` (medium tap)
- Validation error: `vibrate([30, 50, 30])` (error pattern)

### Offline Support
- Wizard inputs: Zustand + localStorage persistence
- Email gate offline: queue request, show local computation results
- Report page: works offline once loaded (all data in Zustand state)
- Sync queue processes when back online

### Pull-to-Refresh
- Report page: "Refresh AI Analysis" button (not browser pull-to-refresh — conflicts with Chrome Android native behavior)
- Button appears below AI narrative section when narrative exists

### Orientation (Mobile)
- Charts in landscape: expand to full viewport
- Cap table pie chart gets larger in landscape
- Wizard: no orientation change behavior

## Backend & AI Integration Notes

The UI/UX spec layers on top of the existing functional spec. Backend requirements from the original spec remain unchanged:

- **10-method valuation engine** runs client-side in browser (zero API cost)
- **Monte Carlo simulation** (10,000 iterations) runs in Web Worker
- **AI narrative** via Claude API (claude-haiku-4-5) — server-side, on-demand only
- **Rate limits:** /api/capture: 10/IP/hour, /api/ai-analysis: 100/day
- **Supabase:** service_role for server routes, RLS for client access
- **Razorpay:** webhook with HMAC SHA256 signature verification
- **Damodaran data:** pre-processed JSON, loaded at build time
- **IBC recovery data:** from 190+ landmark cases, 3,952 corporate debtor outcomes

The UI/UX design adds:
- Framer Motion for all animations (8kb gzipped)
- 4 premium fonts from Fontshare (~40kb total WOFF2)
- Educational tooltip system (client-side, no API)
- Cinematic reveal sequence (client-side state machine)
- Bottom sheet components for mobile (Framer Motion drag)
- Scrollytelling intersection observer for report sections

## Implementation Notes

This UI/UX spec is designed as an **additive layer** on the existing 59-task implementation plan. It does NOT replace the functional spec or plan — it enhances every component with:

1. **Design tokens** (colors, typography, spacing) → applied via Tailwind config + CSS custom properties
2. **Motion patterns** (enter, exit, stagger, scroll) → Framer Motion wrappers around existing components
3. **Mobile adaptations** (bottom sheets, swipe, sticky CTAs) → responsive variants of existing components
4. **Educational content** (tooltips, benchmarks, context) → additional copy integrated into existing components

The existing plan's component structure (wizard steps, result cards, report sections) maps directly to this spec's screen designs.
